Rephysicalized is a global mod that tries to add a bit more physics into ONI, epsecially in conservation of Mass.
This mode is written using AI, so it can have some janky code. However, the mod itself is being properly tested. 


I also have a special lil trailer for it: https://youtu.be/2JsUEALbfzo.
To learn about the main changes, you can read Rephysicalized entry in the codex itself and you can watch a showcase rundown: https://youtu.be/oVMk7b6BKH8
